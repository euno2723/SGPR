This project is aiming for my improvement in the complehension of machine learning theory and the skills to implement machine learning algorithms with as less libraries as possible.

I read a book whose title is "ガウス過程と機械学習" which is written probably mainly based on "Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning" to spread some awareness of the attraction of Gaussian Processes among Japanese people. In that sense, the intention is achieved at least for me in that it successfully make one of the readers gain zeals for further practices. After and among reading the book, I am quite curious about Gaussian Processes and its applications in machine learning


# ディレクトリ構成

* experiments - This is the collection of codes for experiments done to confirm the functionalities of some functions called in the implementation and from Libraries (mainly numpy and scipy).

* SGPR - This is the code for implementation of exact gaussian process regression and sparse gaussian process regression (FITC).
